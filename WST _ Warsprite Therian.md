A **Warsprite** or **Therian** is an [[Aether|Aether]]-based metamorphic life form whose metamorphisis is not wholly genetically determinate, but is influenced towards one of a wide tree of options by environmental factors, not least of which is the natural influence that human imagination has over aether.

Warsprite metamorphosis can be called "evolution" or "shinka." The individual stages are called instars. If we count the egg as the zeroth instar, the second instar is wholly genetically determinate, with the first being a larval form common to multiple genetic expressions, but every instar from the third onward takes in influence from what the warsprite has eaten, what sorts of fights it has gotten into, where it is living, and so on.

Warsprites are more akin to a kingdom than a species. Some are ensouled, some are mere beasts, and some instar forms are only available to the ensouled. There are two determining factors:

1. There are a fixed number of *[[WST nonyma|nonymai]]*, or "soul mothers". When a warsprite with a nonyma dies, the nonyma departs the warsprite and seeks out a bestial Warsprite, and that Warsprite awakens, growing a soul. It is not reincarnation. The Warsprite has a unique and individual soul. But the soul may be influenced by the marks other souls have made on the nonyma.
2. A Warsprite that bonds to a human grows a soul that buds off of the soul of the human to which he is bonded. This is an intended, and Godly, effect, but most Awakened Warsprite communities consider it an abomination. As this soul was grown without the aid of a nonyma, no nonyma is passed on upon the death of the Warsprite.
