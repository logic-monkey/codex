From [[liranev|liranev]] *nef*, "breath", *nymai*, "mother", the part of a [[WST _ Warsprite Therian|warsprite]]'s spiritual makeup that permits a soul to grow. While souls are unique from warsprite to warsprie, nonymai pass from a warsprite on death to an unawakened, or bestial warsprite, usually in the first or second instar, thereby awakening it.
