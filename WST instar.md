Warsprites are a metamorphic kingdom. Each form through which a warsprite passes is called an **instar**, with the zeroth instar being the egg. In general most warsprites undergo 3 instars not counting the egg, with rare ancients reaching a fourth, and legendary warsprites reaching a 5th. There exist 6th instar warsprites, but these are considered on the level of archangles and (lowercase g) gods, and are not believed to have evolved from a previous instar.
