When a uniquely spectacular man acts, the ripples he leaves in time are so large that men before and after him in the time stream get caught up in them.

The result is a slew of characters with similar names, personalities, and life histories. Free Will is not destroyed by a Chrononic Resonance -- a man swept up in a villain's waves may choose to become a hero instead and vice versa -- but most are carried along, playing out the same patterns of thought and action in different lands and different ages. And each who plays along with the pattern solidifies it, making it echo stronger and farther to the ends of the [[timestream|timestreams]].

This is the official excuse for why my stories might follow the "Zelda" pattern of a different Link and a different Zelda in every story. The same character in a different age and setting is not a reincarnation, but a separate individual with a unique soul riding the swirls and eddies of the timestream.
