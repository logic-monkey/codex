The Liranev language is a root language and a naming language. For this reason, no phonotactics are laid out, nor is any grammar described. It should, instead, exist wholly through derived and therefore more fully developed tongues, and names. It is intended to sound elegant and familiar, although not so transparent as a simple mangling of Latin, and to favor sounds I like, so it draws heavily from Greek, from Spanish, and from Proto Indo European. [[WST _ Warsprite Therian|Warsprite]]s draw their species names from it.

As there is nothing more to it than this, here is the lexicon:
