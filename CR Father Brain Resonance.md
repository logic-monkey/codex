# Patterns
- Armies of disposable clones
- Can be killed many times, because the Jellybrain who is killed is always a clone.
- When clone Jellybrains meet, it is called the Brain Trust.
- The Jellybrain the heroes face off with is a cartoonish "Skeletor"-like Flanderization who loves evil, but this is due to copy errors. Father Brain himself is a more rounded character than the members of the Brain Trust.
- Creates an ultimate assassin who turns good [[CR Jump the Shark Resonance|Jump the Shark Resonance]].
- A descendant of Father Brain turns heroic and becomes a robotics specialist as part of his rebellion ([[CR Jellyboy Resonance|Jellyboy Resonance]]).
